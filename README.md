# 🕶️ Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) Experience – Unity + Vuforia

This repository contains the source code and assets for a complete Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using **Unity** and **Vuforia**.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a functional and interactive AR application that showcases a variety of features and user interactions. The application integrates virtual 3D/2D content with real-world markers and enables users to interact with the augmented elements through a structured scenario.

## ✅ Features

The application demonstrates the following core features:

- 🧱 **Stationary Virtual 3D Object**: A fixed virtual object appears over a tracked image target.
- 🕺 **Animated Virtual 3D Object**: An object with pre-defined animations plays on detection.
- 🎮 **Moving Object (2D/3D)**: An object moves within the scene (e.g., along a path or towards user input).
- 🔤 **Textual Virtual Object**: Text is rendered in the AR scene, always facing the user.
- 🖼️ **Image Mapping**: A virtual object maps and displays a user-provided picture.
- 📹 **Video Mapping**: A video file is rendered as a virtual object and plays on detection.
- 🧩 **Three-Step Interactive Scenario**: A mini-scenario where users interact sequentially with virtual elements.
- 🖱️ **Virtual Object Selection**: At least two distinct interactions where users select virtual objects.
- 📲 **Scenario Switch via Buttons**: UI buttons are included for toggling between AR scenarios.
