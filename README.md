# üï∂Ô∏è Interactive Augmented Reality (AR) Experience ‚Äì Unity + Vuforia

This repository contains the source code and assets for a complete Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using **Unity** and **Vuforia** as part of an academic assignment.

## üéØ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a functional and interactive AR application that showcases a variety of features and user interactions. The application integrates virtual 3D/2D content with real-world markers and enables users to interact with the augmented elements through a structured scenario.

## ‚úÖ Features

The application demonstrates the following core features:

- üß± **Stationary Virtual 3D Object**: A fixed virtual object appears over a tracked image target.
- üï∫ **Animated Virtual 3D Object**: An object with pre-defined animations plays on detection.
- üéÆ **Moving Object (2D/3D)**: An object moves within the scene (e.g., along a path or towards user input).
- üî§ **Textual Virtual Object**: Text is rendered in the AR scene, always facing the user.
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Mapping**: A virtual object maps and displays a user-provided picture.
- üìπ **Video Mapping**: A video file is rendered as a virtual object and plays on detection.
- üß© **Three-Step Interactive Scenario**: A mini-scenario where users interact sequentially with virtual elements.
- üñ±Ô∏è **Virtual Object Selection**: At least two distinct interactions where users select virtual objects.
- üì≤ **Scenario Switch via Buttons**: Two UI buttons are included for toggling between AR scenarios.
